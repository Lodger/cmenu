cmenu is a lightweight and customizable menu for X, based on the menu included
in the Calm Window Manager. Input lines are read from stdin and displayed in a
menu next to the pointer to click on or search for. When the return key is
pressed, the currently highlighted line is written to stdout, and the menu is
closed. If no input lines match the search line, then the contents of the search
line are instead written to stdout.


All the configuration options in config.h are also available through
command-line options, however the defaults can easily be changed by adding them
to config.h, and reinstalling.

Installation:
	git clone https://github.com/emanresudab/cmenu
