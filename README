cmenu is a lightweight, customizable menu for X, inspired by the menu included
in the Calm window manager.  Newline-delimited arguments are read in from
stdin, and are displayed on the screen for the user to choose from.  When a
line has been selected, cmenu will write the chosen line to stdout.If the
provided input matches none of the supplied lines, the input will instead be
written to stdout.

All the configuration options in config.h are also available through
command-line options, however the defaults can easily be changed by adding them
to config.h, and reinstalling.
